# Product-List-app




Create React App is divided into two packages:

create-react-app is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
react-scripts is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).
You almost never need to update create-react-app itself: it delegates all the setup to react-scripts.



For the project to build, these files must exist with exact filenames:

public/index.html is the page template;
src/index.js is the JavaScript entry point.
You can delete or rename the other files.

You may create subdirectories inside src. For faster rebuilds, only files inside src are processed by Webpack.
You need to put any JS and CSS files inside src, or Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

Only files inside public can be used from public/index.html.
Read instructions below for using assets from JavaScript and HTML.

You can, however, create more top-level directories.
They will not be included in the production build so you can use them for things like documentation.



Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
